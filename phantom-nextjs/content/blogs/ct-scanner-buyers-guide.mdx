# CT Scanner Buyer's Guide: 16-Slice vs 64-Slice vs 128-Slice Systems

Computed Tomography (CT) scanners have become indispensable in modern medical diagnostics. However, choosing the right CT scanner configuration can be challenging. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the differences between 16-slice, 64-slice, and 128-slice CT systems.

## Understanding CT Slice Technology

The "slice" count refers to the number of detector rows that simultaneously acquire image data. More slices generally mean:

- **Faster Scan Times** - Complete examinations in seconds
- **Better Image Quality** - Higher resolution and detail
- **Advanced Applications** - Cardiac imaging, CT angiography
- **Increased Throughput** - More patients per day

## 16-Slice CT Scanners
