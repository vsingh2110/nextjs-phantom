## Work Log: July 13, 2024

### Summary of Work Done (Last Few Hours)
- Unified counter animation logic across all three counter components (desktop/tablet, mobile horizontal, vertical mobile) to ensure smooth counting for both large and small values.
- Adjusted animation duration for small values (like COUNTRIES COVERED) for a smoother effect.
- Lowered Intersection Observer threshold for the counter section to improve animation triggering reliability.
- Multiple attempts to align and size the 'Why Choose Us' cards at xl and above, including:
  - Using aspect-square and min/max width for uniformity.
  - Adding overflow handling for content.
  - Ensuring no changes were made to mobile or tablet versions.
- UI/UX changes and scaling tweaks were made to maintain visual consistency and premium look at all breakpoints.

### Current Unresolved Issues
- The first 'Why Choose Us' card (15+ Years of Experience) still appears taller or visually different at xl and above due to longer content; font and box scaling need further adjustment.
- Counter animation does not always re-trigger if the section is always visible on page load; may require a more robust solution for guaranteed replay.
- General scaling and responsiveness concerns remain for ultra-wide and edge-case breakpoints.

### Workflow & Documentation Notes
- User prefers real-time, detailed work logs and dev notes, not just end-of-session summaries.
- Some work log entries were missed earlier; this entry consolidates all recent changes and issues.
- All future changes should continue to be logged in real time, as per user protocol.

### Next Session TODO
- Start with resizing all 'Why Choose Us' cards at 1280px (xl) only, making them a bit smaller, but do NOT touch mobile or tablet versions. Ensure all cards remain visually consistent and avoid breaking the existing layout.

## Work Log: July 13, 2024 (Why Choose Us Section)

### Iterative Work & User Feedback (Real-Time Log)
- **Initial User Request:** Fix the 'Why Choose Us' cards at 1280px (xl) and above, where the first card was visually different (taller/wider) than the others. User emphasized not to touch mobile or tablet versions, and to keep all cards visually consistent.
- **First Attempts:** Applied `aspect-square`, `min-w`, and `max-w` at xl+ to all cards. This made all cards square, but the first card's content (long heading and paragraph) overflowed or caused scrollbars, which was not visually acceptable.
- **User Feedback:** User noted the first card was still visually different, and that the font size and scaling seemed off. User expressed frustration that the scaling/responsiveness work had made things worse, not better.
- **Further Attempts:** Tried reducing box size at xl, adjusting padding, and using `overflow-auto` to handle content overflow. None of these fully solved the visual mismatch without breaking the layout or introducing scrollbars.
- **User Protocol Reminders:** User repeatedly reminded not to touch mobile/tablet, not to break the existing structure, and to avoid reducing font size for just one card. User requested all changes be logged in real time, not just at the end.
- **Scaling/Responsiveness Issues:** Multiple tweaks to grid gap, card width, and aspect ratio were made, but the first card's content (due to its length) continued to cause height/overflow issues at xl+.
- **Current State:** All cards use the same width and aspect ratio at xl+, but the first card's content still makes it appear visually different. No changes were made to mobile or tablet layouts.
- **User Frustration:** User expressed strong frustration at the lack of progress and the time spent, and requested a full, honest work log entry.

### Pending Prompt for Next Session
- **TODO:** Resize all 'Why Choose Us' cards at 1280px (xl) only, making them a bit smaller, but do NOT touch mobile or tablet versions. Ensure all cards remain visually consistent and avoid breaking the existing layout. This is to be executed at the start of the next session.
