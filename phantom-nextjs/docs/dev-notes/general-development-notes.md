## üèóÔ∏è **Project Architecture & Technical Decisions**

### **1. Next.js Configuration & Performance**
- **Bundle Analyzer:** Enabled for performance monitoring
- **Image Optimization:** Using `remotePatterns` instead of deprecated `domains`
- **Cross-Origin Handling:** `allowedDevOrigins` for development environments
- **Performance Monitoring:** Webpack bundle analysis for optimization

### **2. Google Maps Integration**
- **Current Status:** Working with hardcoded API key
- **Reason for Hardcoded:** Environment variables caused performance issues
- **Security:** User will handle API security in Google Cloud Platform
- **Performance Issues:** Lazy loading + environment variables = chaos
- **Decision:** Keep maps working, don't touch hardcoded API key

### **3. Responsive Design Strategy**
- **Ultra-wide Screen Support:** 1920px+ scaling implemented
- **Device-Specific Images:** Horizontal desktop, vertical mobile
- **Mobile-First Approach:** Responsive breakpoints optimized
- **Section Standardization:** Consistent padding and height across sections

## üé® **UI/UX Best Practices & Decisions**

### **1. Color Scheme & Branding**
- **Primary Green:** `#59913d` (from download brochure)
- **Hover Green:** `#255a0a` (darker shade)
- **Gradient Theme:** Green shades for consistent branding
- **Font Smoothing:** Tailwind's `antialiased` and `subpixel-antialiased`

### **2. Performance Optimization Patterns**
- **Lazy Loading:** For heavy components (iframes, images)
- **Memoization:** `useCallback` and `useMemo` for expensive operations
- **Loading States:** Professional user experience with loading indicators
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks for failed operations

### **3. Accessibility Standards**
- **ARIA Labels:** Proper accessibility attributes
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Focus management for modals
- **Screen Reader Support:** Semantic HTML structure
- **Color Contrast:** WCAG compliant color combinations

## üîß **Development Workflow & Tools**

### **1. Work Log Management (CRITICAL)**
- **NEVER Overwrite:** Always add to existing work logs
- **Preserve Context:** Office vs home, day vs night sessions
- **Document Decisions:** Why certain approaches were chosen
- **Maintain Chronology:** Keep session order intact

### **2. CONCURRENT DOCUMENTATION UPDATES (CRITICAL)**
- **Real-time Updates:** Update BOTH work logs AND general notes DURING development
- **No End-of-Session Updates:** Don't wait until session end to document
- **Simultaneous Updates:** Every technical decision documented immediately
- **Memory Preservation:** Prevents losing 90% of information when trying to recall later

#### **Why Concurrent Updates Are Critical:**
- **Memory Loss:** Assistant forgets 90% of details when asked to update at session end
- **Context Loss:** Important technical decisions and rationale get lost
- **Reference Loss:** Compiled resources and tools not properly documented
- **Continuity Loss:** Development flow and decision-making process not preserved

#### **Concurrent Update Protocol:**
1. **During Development:** Update both files as decisions are made
2. **Immediate Documentation:** Every technical detail recorded in real-time
3. **Context Preservation:** Why decisions were made documented immediately
4. **Resource Compilation:** Tools, websites, references added as discovered

### **3. File Organization**
- **Work Logs:** Session-specific progress and decisions
- **General Notes:** This file for overall knowledge
- **Technical Specs:** Detailed implementation details
- **Reference Materials:** Compiled resources and tools

### **4. Session Structure**
- **Day Sessions:** Office work with comprehensive UI/UX
- **Night Sessions:** Home development with performance optimization
- **Documentation:** Every session must be documented
- **Context Preservation:** Why decisions were made

## üöÄ **Performance Optimization Techniques**

### **1. Component Optimization**
```typescript
// Lazy loading with loading states
const [isIframeLoaded, setIsIframeLoaded] = useState(false);
const [iframeError, setIframeError] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Memoized handlers
const openModal = useCallback(() => {
  setIsModalOpen(true);
  setIsIframeLoaded(false);
  setIframeError(null);
}, []);
```

### **2. Image Optimization**
- **Device-specific images:** Different images for mobile/desktop
- **Lazy loading:** `loading="lazy"` attribute
- **Responsive sizing:** Viewport-based dimensions
- **Format optimization:** WebP when possible

### **3. Bundle Optimization**
- **Code splitting:** Automatic with Next.js
- **Tree shaking:** Remove unused code
- **Minification:** Production builds
- **Gzip compression:** Server-level optimization

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Decisions & Rationale**

### **1. Why Environment Variables Were Abandoned**
- **Complex setup:** `.env.local`, `.gitignore`, CORS issues
- **Development restarts:** Had to restart server every time
- **File permission issues:** Couldn't edit `.env` files easily
- **Performance impact:** Caused "Loading map..." issues
- **Too many moving parts:** API keys, environment variables, lazy loading

### **2. Why Hardcoded API Key Works**
- **Simpler setup:** No environment configuration needed
- **Better performance:** No additional loading complexity
- **Development friendly:** Works immediately on localhost
- **Security acceptable:** User handles production security

### **3. Why Work Logs Must Never Be Overwritten**
- **User works day and night:** Multiple sessions per day
- **Hard work compilation:** Significant effort in gathering information
- **Future reference needed:** Essential for continued development
- **No backup exists:** Once overwritten, information is permanently lost

## üö® SPECIAL DEV NOTE: Local Dev Security Exceptions (July 13, 2025)

### **Temporary Local Development Settings**

#### 1. **X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL**
- **Purpose:** Allows the app to be embedded in iframes for responsive testing tools (e.g., responsivetesttool.com).
- **How:** Set in `next.config.js` under `headers()` as:
  ```js
  {
    key: 'X-Frame-Options',
    value: 'ALLOWALL', // WARNING: Only for local dev!
  }
  ```
- **WARNING:** This must be **REMOVED** or set to `SAMEORIGIN`/`DENY` before deploying to production. Leaving this open in production is a major security risk (clickjacking, data leaks, etc).

#### 2. **Google Maps API Key (Hardcoded)**
- **Purpose:** Used for local development convenience.
- **How:** The API key is hardcoded in the codebase for now.
- **WARNING:** This key must be **REMOVED** or secured (via environment variables or server-side proxy) before deployment. Exposing API keys in production is a major security risk and can lead to quota theft or abuse.

### **Action Items Before Deployment**
- [ ] Remove or secure all local-only headers and settings.
- [ ] Move Google Maps API key to a secure location (env var, server, or GCP restrictions).
- [ ] Set `X-Frame-Options` to `SAMEORIGIN` or `DENY` in production.
- [ ] Double-check for any other local dev exceptions.

**Last Updated:** July 13, 2025 (Night Session)
**Next Review:** July 20, 2025
**Status:** Active development documentation
**Maintainer:** Development Team 

### [2024-07-12] Scrollbar Hiding Utility
- Added a `scrollbar-hide` utility class in `globals.css` for visually hiding scrollbars in scrollable sections.
- Uses `::-webkit-scrollbar`, `-ms-overflow-style`, and `scrollbar-width` for cross-browser support ([ref](https://dev.to/logrocket/how-to-use-css-to-hide-scrollbars-without-impacting-scrolling-2eba)).
- For accessibility: only use to hide scrollbars for aesthetic reasons, never to hide important content. Always ensure content is accessible via keyboard and screen readers (add ARIA attributes as needed). 

### [2024-07-12] Dev Note: Commented Reference Code Must Not Be Altered
- Mistake: The assistant changed the design/colors of the commented-out vertical counter code when only an uncomment was requested.
- **Warning:** Commented reference code is a protected artifact and must never be altered unless explicitly requested by the user.
- This is a workflow and trust issue. Always restore or uncomment reference code exactly as it was, with no design or logic changes, unless the user asks for a modification.
