# Conversation Recap - July 14, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. About Section Background Image (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: Background image not showing in About Phantom Healthcare section
- **Root Cause**: Conflicting `bg-gray-50` class was overriding the background image
- **Solution**: Removed the conflicting background color class and applied background image via inline styles
- **Result**: Background image now displays properly with dark overlay and white text

### 2. Font Size Adjustments (COMPLETED)
- **Request**: Reduce font sizes for About section heading and paragraph
- **Changes Made**: 
  - Heading: Changed from `text-3xl lg:text-4xl` to `text-2xl sm:text-3xl lg:text-4xl`
  - Paragraph: Changed from `text-base` to `text-sm sm:text-base`
- **Result**: More appropriate font sizing for the section

### 3. YouTube Video Embed Issues (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: YouTube video showing black screen with no visible content or play button
- **Problem**: Basic iframe embeds have compatibility issues with Next.js security policies
- **Solution**: Implemented `react-youtube` library (452k+ weekly downloads)
- **Changes Made**:
  - Installed `react-youtube` package
  - Created `YouTubeEmbed.tsx` client component with `'use client'` directive
  - Replaced problematic iframe with `<YouTube>` component
  - Added proper styling with `className` and `iframeClassName`
  - Configured player options for optimal display
- **Result**: Video embed should now display properly with controls and play button

### 3.1. Server Component Error Fix (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: Runtime error "Class extends value undefined is not a constructor" - React class components can't be used in Server Components
- **Problem**: `react-youtube` is a class component that conflicts with Next.js App Router Server Components
- **Solution**: Created separate client component `YouTubeEmbed.tsx` with `'use client'` directive
- **Changes Made**:
  - Created `src/components/YouTubeEmbed.tsx` as client component
  - Moved YouTube logic to client component
  - Updated main page to import and use the client component
  - Maintained server-side rendering for the rest of the page
- **Result**: YouTube embed works properly while keeping the page as a Server Component

### 3.2. Event Handler Error Fix (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props" error
- **Problem**: `onReady` event handler was being passed to the `YouTube` class component
- **Solution**: Removed the `onReady` event handler to simplify the component
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed `onReady` function from `YouTubeEmbed.tsx`
  - Kept only essential props: `videoId`, `opts`, `className`, `iframeClassName`
  - Simplified component to avoid event handler conflicts
- **Result**: YouTube embed works without event handler errors

### 4. Next.js Configuration Updates (COMPLETED)
- **Issue**: Security headers blocking embedding during development
- **Solution**: Updated `next.config.js` to conditionally apply headers based on environment
- **Changes**:
  - Development: `X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL` for testing
  - Production: `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` for security
  - Conditional `X-Content-Type-Options` header
  - Added YouTube domains to allowed patterns
  - Added Content Security Policy for YouTube embeds
- **Result**: Development environment allows proper embedding while maintaining production security

### 5. Syntax Error Fix (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: Invalid syntax `{image.png}` in Next.js config
- **Solution**: Removed the invalid syntax
- **Result**: Configuration file now loads without errors
