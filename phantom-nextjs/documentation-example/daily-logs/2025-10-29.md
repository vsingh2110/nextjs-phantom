# Daily Log — 29 October 2025

- **Location/System:** Office desktop (Windows, VS Code with AI agents)
- **Participants:** Human owner, GitHub Copilot (lead AI), prior external AI advisors
- **Focus:** Establish documentation framework and capture project blueprint

## Summary
- Created foundational documentation folder structure for the MindScape Research website project.
- Captured project overview, roadmap, collaboration guidelines, content strategy, and operational guardrails based on prior multi-agent discussions.
- Initialized the MindScape Research Next.js codebase, integrated MDX rendering, and scaffolded Decap CMS for Git-based content management.

## Tasks Completed
- Established `documentation/` directory with core reference files.
- Drafted comprehensive project overview including mission, architecture, and phases.
- Documented precautions, collaboration processes, roadmap, and content strategy.
- Logged current context for future contributors.
- Generated Next.js app scaffold (`mindscape-research/`), installed core dependencies (Supabase, Stripe, MDX, tailwind), and committed initial code.
- Added Decap CMS configuration under `public/admin/`, created sample MDX content (`src/content/*`), and wired custom MDX components/helpers.
- Pointed Decap CMS backend to the GitHub repository (`vsingh2110/mindscape-research`), enabled `local_backend`, and documented OAuth login flow for contributors.
- Replaced default pages with MindScape-specific homepage, research/blog listings, newsletter placeholder, and dynamic MDX routes.
- Updated project `README.md` with stack overview and contributor workflow notes.
- Folded the Next.js app into the root repository so Vercel deployments can target `mindscape-research/`.

## Decisions & Notes
- Working organization name set to **MindScape Research** for the active build; alternative names remain on standby until branding is finalized.
- Single-domain strategy reaffirmed (no subdomains for commerce at this stage).
- Payment infrastructure will use Stripe integrated directly within the Next.js app, with Lemon Squeezy as backup if requirements change.
- Content stack will blend a headless CMS (Sanity, Contentful, or Strapi/Payload) with in-repo MDX articles, managed via GitHub workflows.
- Email and analytics tools shortlist: Resend vs. Postmark, Plausible vs. Umami (privacy-first preference).
- Hosting target confirmed as **Vercel Hobby** with Decap CMS using GitHub backend (custom domain to be added once purchased).
- Deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` replaced with `@supabase/ssr`; nodemailer upgraded to satisfy next-auth peer requirements.

## Open Questions / Pending Actions
- Validate final brand name (currently **MindScape Research**) and secure matching .org domain.
- Select email provider and analytics stack.
- Define tooling for project management (e.g., Notion, Jira) and communication channels.
- Configure Decap CMS authentication (GitHub OAuth or Netlify Identity) and optional Cloudinary media backend.
- Deploy GitHub OAuth proxy on Vercel for Decap CMS and store credentials securely.
- Stand up Supabase project and apply initial schema/migrations.
- Begin Phase 1 development environment setup once name/domain decisions are finalized.
- Finish Vercel deployment (verify latest build succeeds, add OAuth env vars, redeploy) and confirm `/admin` login flow.

## Next Steps (Tentative for 30 October 2025)
1. Configure authentication + editorial workflow for Decap CMS (GitHub OAuth app).
2. Draft initial wireframes or content outlines for homepage.
3. Create Supabase project and prepare schema migration scripts.
4. Begin implementing shared layout/navigation and hook up Supabase client utilities.

### Evening Continuation (Home setup)
- Investigated `/admin` deployment issue on Vercel after automated redeploys continued to return a Decap schema error.
- Identified that the manual Decap bootstrap was passing an incomplete config object; rewrote the admin loader to fetch `/admin/config.yml` manually, parse with `js-yaml`, and pass the config object directly into `CMS.init` while disabling the default `/config.yml` fetch.
- Wired `backend.base_url` + `auth_endpoint` in `config.yml` so the hosted CMS invokes the Vercel GitHub OAuth proxy instead of Netlify’s default flow.
- Disabled `local_backend` in `config.yml` so the live CMS always uses the GitHub backend after authentication.
- Confirmed next step is to retest the live `/admin` route once the new build finishes and continue with OAuth proxy setup if config loads. ..
